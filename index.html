    <h1>Page Replacement Algorithms</h1>
    <div class="algorithm-list">
      <!-- FIFO -->
      <div class="algo">
        <h2>First-In First-Out (FIFO)</h2>
        <p>
          The FIFO page replacement algorithm is one of the simplest, where the
          oldest pages in memory are replaced first. As the name suggests, the
          first page loaded into memory will be the first to be replaced when
          the memory is full. This approach does not take into account how often
          a page is used, potentially replacing frequently accessed pages. It is
          easy to implement but can lead to inefficient use of memory.

      <!-- LRU -->
      <div class="algo">
        <h2>Least Recently Used (LRU)</h2>
        <p>
          The LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm keeps track of the order of
          page usage and replaces the page that hasnâ€™t been used for the longest
          time. This is a more intuitive approach than FIFO because it is based
          on the assumption that pages which haven't been used recently are less
          likely to be used in the near future. The LRU algorithm is widely used
          and often leads to better performance than FIFO.

      <!-- LFU -->
      <div class="algo">
        <h2>Least Frequently Used (LFU)</h2>
        <p>
          The LFU (Least Frequently Used) algorithm replaces the page that has
          the lowest access frequency. It is based on the idea that pages that
          are accessed more frequently are more likely to be used again soon.
          This method keeps track of the frequency of access for each page and
          prioritizes pages with fewer accesses for replacement. LFU can be
          efficient but may suffer from the problem of "aging," where older
          pages might be kept in memory due to higher historical usage.

      <!-- MRU -->
      <div class="algo">
        <h2>Most Recently Used (MRU)</h2>
        <p>
          The MRU (Most Recently Used) algorithm replaces the most recently
          accessed page. This approach works well in scenarios where the most
          recently accessed pages are less likely to be needed in the near
          future. MRU is not as commonly used as LRU, but it can be effective
          for certain workloads, such as in database systems where recent data
          is often discarded after use.

      <!-- Optimal -->
      <div class="algo">
        <h2>Optimal Page Replacement</h2>
        <p>
          The Optimal Page Replacement algorithm replaces the page that will not
          be used for the longest period of time in the future. By knowing the
          future requests, this algorithm can make perfect decisions, though it
          is impractical in real-world scenarios since future page references
          are unknown. However, it is useful as a benchmark for evaluating other
          algorithms.
